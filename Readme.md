App Icon Generator
-----

A an Apple developer, what is the best tool we can use to create our app icon ?

The answer is of course SwiftUI ðŸ¤¡ ! 

That is why I created the App Icon Generator, a macOS app that will help you create the icon of your dreams, easily, in nice SwiftUI code.

For rendering the icon, we use the `bitmapImageRepForCachingDisplay` method.
